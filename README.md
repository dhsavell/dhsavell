### Hello! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Joe. I am interested in technical art, tools engineering, and computer graphics. On this account, you can find my work and school contributions.

##### Other Projects
For organization purposes, I've transferred my personal projects (Beat Machine, vdcrpt, raylib VR, etc.) to [@branchpanic](https://github.com/branchpanic). Development will continue there.
